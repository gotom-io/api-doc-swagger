        Notice that when changing the customer, it will apply the new customer discounts automatically. 
        
        When changing or setting agency/intermediator, by default, commissions will be set to the values found in the agency/intermediator again. Even if the commission was set on the flight. Updating agency/intermediator to `null` will, by default, set the commissions to `0` and the `commissionStatus` as well to `0`.
        
        When agency/intermediator are sent in the body and you don't want to update the commissions you can use the query parameter `update_commissions=0`.

        - in: query

            Whether to update commissions or not
             * **0**: commissions will not be updated and stay the same even if agency and/or intermediator are changed. Flights created hereafter will use the old commissions.
             * **1**: commissions will be updated only if the payload as well has values set for the intermediator or agency. Flights created hereafter will always use those commissions as well. If you have set custom flight commissions manually on flights, they will be reset to the values of the agency/intermediator.
